Main purpose of this project is to provide a simple yet usefull landing page. All the data is stored locally in the browser. 
So there is no need to worry about losing your current timer or weather api.

## First launch guide
* on main page You are provided with a special search bar. The default search engine is `DuckDuckGoGo`. By using specified prefixes you can search directly on some sites. This includes:
  * `-y` for youtube
  * `-w` for wikipedia in english
  * `-r` for reddit
* to start using weather api You will need your api key and city name. you can get these here [openweather](https://openweathermap.org/) then just press enter
* to toggle pomodoro timer, just click on the digital clock. It will cycle through `work` and `break` modes, by default set to 25 amd 5 minutes
* to add items to your to do list just type to a input and press enter. Then You will be able to mark the task complete or remove it.

## Current features
* quick access link
* weather app
* pomodoro timer, with sound alert
* to do list

## What's coming next?
I am plannig to make this fully customizable. This includes:
* setting your own theme
* changing decorative picture
* changing icons and links
* changing search engines and shortcuts
